3. Activate the virtual environment:
   • Windows:
   Bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

• Linux/macOS:

source venv/bin/activate

4. Install
   dependencies:

# Technology Stack:

• Flask: Python web framework
• Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive design
• Weather API: Provides real-time weather data

# Accessibility Note:

Due to the developer's reliance on screen readers (NVDA) for development, the front-end design might require additional enhancements for optimal accessibility.
